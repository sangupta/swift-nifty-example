swift-nifty-example
===================

This is a working example of a client-server interaction using Facebook's opensource Nifty and
Swift frameworks. 

[Nifty](https://github.com/facebook/nifty) is an implementation of [Thrift](http://thrift.apache.org/) clients and servers on [Netty](http://netty.io).

[Swift](https://github.com/facebook/swift) is an easy-to-use, annotation-based Java library for creating Thrift serializable types and services.

Serves a simple advantage: *No need for code generation outside of Java*
